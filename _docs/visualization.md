In the following we see some ways how to visualize the raw data and the models.
First let us plot the raw data of the infected people.

![Figure 3]({{ "/assets/img/fig3.png" | relative_url }} "Figure 3")

Then we plot two models with different parameters:

![Figure 1]({{ "/assets/img/fig1.png" | relative_url }} "Figure 1")

and

![Figure 2]({{ "/assets/img/fig2.png" | relative_url }} "Figure 2")
